Selector Scripts
 
  Starting with plugin version 1.5, a custom script can be used to skip individual projects based on 
  whatever criteria expressed in the script as illustrated in the following example. Assume the 
  following directory structure:

+------------------
./
+- pom.xml
+- src/
   +- it/
      +- settings.xml
      +- conditional-it/
         +- pom.xml
         +- check-assumptions.bsh
         +- src/
+------------------

  The plugin configuration for this example would look like this:

+------------------
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-invoker-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <projectsDirectory>src/it</projectsDirectory>
          <cloneProjectsTo>\${project.build.directory}/it</cloneProjectsTo>
          <pomIncludes>
            <pomInclude>*/pom.xml</pomInclude>
          </pomIncludes>
          <settingsFile>src/it/settings.xml</settingsFile>
          <localRepositoryPath>\${project.build.directory}/local-repo</localRepositoryPath>
          <selectorScript>check-assumptions.bsh</selectorScript>
        </configuration>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>integration-test</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>install</goal>
              <goal>run</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+------------------

  If the check-assumptions.bsh script returns <<<true>>> or does not return a value, then the project will be executed.

  If the script returns any value other than <<<true>>>, then the project will not be executed.

  If the script throws an exception, then the project will be marked as being in ERROR.

Predefined global variables

  In Selector Scripts the same global variables are defined as in {{{./pre-post-build-script.html#predefined-global-variables}Pre and Post Build Script}}
