Inspect logs for failed tests

  In the usual build all tests pass as we expect,
  so printing logs from all tests to project build log make our standard build log illegible.
  The problem begin when some of test was failed,
  especially when happened on CI system when access to files from build workspace is difficult.

  In order to help investigation on failed test we can use option: <<<streamLogsOnFailures>>>.
  Now logs from all failed test will be printed to project build log when all test will have finished.
